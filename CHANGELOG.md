## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Redesigned all modal overlay dialogs (Login, Save As, New Drawing, Help & Shortcuts, Project Manager, Admin Setup, and Admin Hub) to use the global light theme tokens and generic classes defined in `index.css`.
- Batch solve matrix no longer uses a hardcoded `localhost` backend URL; it now uses the relative `/api/simulation/batch` endpoint, fixing the CORS / `ERR_FAILED` error when deployed behind a reverse proxy (e.g. Cloudflare).
