# Changelog

All notable changes to the WälFlow project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Redesigned all modal overlay dialogs (Login, Save As, New Drawing, Help & Shortcuts, Project Manager, Admin Setup, and Admin Hub) to use the global light theme tokens and generic classes defined in `index.css`.
- Batch solve matrix no longer uses a hardcoded `localhost` backend URL; it now uses the relative `/api/simulation/batch` endpoint, fixing the CORS / `ERR_FAILED` error when deployed behind a reverse proxy (e.g. Cloudflare).
- Fixed canvas loading overlay race conditions on synchronous example diagrams (e.g., API 614) by deferring heavy state updates to the next event loop tick.
- Implemented immediate modal closure and canvas loading overlay display during database fetches, enabling smooth wave animations on the compositor during network idle times.
- Realigned `FlowDropMark` SVG structure to nest flow lines within the pulsating container, and toggled SVG animations when hidden to save CPU.
- Configured correct `pointerEvents` on `CanvasLoadingOverlay` to block mouse clicks during canvas loads.

### Fixed

- Resolved canvas state recovery loss and database synchronization detachment on page refresh.
- Resolved development-only empty canvas bug where React StrictMode unmount cleared the hydration timeout without rescheduling it.
- Refactored local session draft validation to use the dynamic `FILE_FORMAT_VERSION` constant rather than a hardcoded string.
