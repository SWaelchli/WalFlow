# Findings

Open issues to implement or review. This list is temporary: delete a finding's overview row and detail row in the
same change that commits its fix (the commit and `CHANGELOG.md` are the record). Layout and rules: `walflow-qa`
skill, "Findings list".

- IDs are for this list only. Never put them in code, test names, param ids or comments; describe the behaviour.
- Fix test-first where a test has value; the **Test** column follows the bug-fix decision tree
  (law → reference row → scenario → new test). "Gate" means lint/build is the check and no new test is added.
- Run the gate (`walflow-gate-runner`) before marking a finding fixed.

Status: `Open` (agreed, to implement) · `Review` (needs a decision or a physics check first) · `In progress` · `Fixed` (remove at commit) · `Deferred` · `Rejected`

Owner: `orch` (orchestrator: backend/simulation, API) · `fe` (`walflow-frontend-dev`) · `phys` (`walflow-physics-reviewer` after the change)
